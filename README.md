Problem Statement
	Our customers and referrals are not our ideal customer profile. The solutions we are offering have become more sophisticated than our customer want/need for their new business concept. We are experiencing slower transaction cycles due to weak marketing and advertising activities that make sense to the market place. 

Areas of interest to improve upon
Lead Generating and Customer Acquisition Activities.
Vetting and winning more ideal customers
Customer Onboarding

Frequency of problem and impact
This problem occurs once out of every three customers
It creates issues in the business processes 
It creates issues in the roles and responsibilities 
It creates issues in the morale in leadership, management, and service layers. 

The problem Cost Factor:
	On average we attempt to run three projects in a sales cycle. 
This generates $1,050 in revenue however we normally lose one project during a cycle which brings down our sales revenue to $700. 

In an optimally running operation we can run 12 projects a month for a total of sales revenue of $4,200 a month.

Currently we are only projecting 2,800 in sales revenue a month. Which means
our inefficiency is costing us $1,400 a month.

Goal Statement
	Increase product and service transactions from the projected monthly sales revenue pf $2,800 to a sustained sales revenue of $4,200 by September 30th 2021.

Conclusion

	I believe a value proposition implementation project would allow both teams to determine if collaborating on offerings would be mutually beneficial for both parties. 

 In order to effectively and efficiently test this theory, I propose a charter be drafted similar to the charter I have provided identifying the relative problem statement and goals would be the next step in the process. Once I receive the charter I can combine them into a complete project charter and schedule a meeting to discuss the project further.
